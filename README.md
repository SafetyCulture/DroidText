This is no longer available. The code in this repo needs to be fixed in order to compile it in Android (will commit changes soon). To be specific, all the package names need the first word (directory) removed.

DISCLAIMER - I have not added any work to this project as of yet - I am merely looking into how to make a
version of iTextG (based on the original LGPL project DroidText).
